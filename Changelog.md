# Autologger Destroyer Changelog

1/32/26 <3

*Includes*
- Logging to see what disabled, and what was ran! (Kinda Ironic since we're disabling autologgers)
- Autologger Destroyer Backup Folder Creation.
- Autologger Destroyer Backup Folder duplication check, to avoid overwriting existing backups.
- Autologger Reg Backup Creation.
- Windows Version Check, since Windows 11 user who disable EventLog-Application and EventLog-System will have a broken file explorer.
- Autologger Reg Backup Failure Error Handling.
- Autologger Destroyer Start Screen.
- Autologger Disabler (Duh).
